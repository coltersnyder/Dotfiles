.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The `mojo` CLI provides all the tools you need for Mojo development, such as commands to run, compile, and package Mojo code. A list of all commands are listed below, and you can learn more about each one by adding the `\-\-help` option to the command (for example, `mojo package \-\-help`).

However, you may omit the `run` and `repl` commands. That is, you can run a Mojo file by simply passing the filename to `mojo`:

    mojo hello.mojo

And you can start a REPL session by running `mojo` with no commands.

To update Mojo to the latest version, use the [`modular` tool](https://docs.modular.com/cli/):

    modular update mojo

You can check your current version with `mojo \-\-version`. For information about Mojo updates, see the [Mojo changelog](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/changelog.html).
